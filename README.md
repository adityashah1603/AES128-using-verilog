# AES128-using-verilog
Implementing verilog code for the AES-128 algorithm

The given project allows you to implement a verilog code for the AES-128 algorithm. The Verilog code contains 8 modules
For a user to run the project successfully, you only have to run the AES_main module and look at the output produced in the verilog simulation.

This can be further dumped into an FPGA, showcasing Hardware Cryptography.
